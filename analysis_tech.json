      "title": "Semiconductor Market & AI Infrastructure Face Supply Challenges",
      "summary": "SK Hynix warns that DRAM supply shortages are expected to persist until 2028. Oracle's stock dropped, and its plans for multiple 'StarGate' OpenAI data centers are delayed due to material shortages, indicating a broader challenge in scaling AI infrastructure. Despite this, new efficient AI hardware like DEEPX's 30W V-NPU for video streaming continues to emerge.",
      "prediction": "The prolonged DRAM shortage will likely drive up memory prices and impact manufacturing costs for electronics. AI infrastructure expansion will face continued bottlenecks from supply chain constraints and high investment costs, potentially slowing the progress of large-scale AI projects for some companies. However, innovations in specialized, efficient AI chips will enable more localized and pervasive AI applications.",

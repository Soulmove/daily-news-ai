  "economy_summary": "The global economic outlook is heavily influenced by escalating geopolitical tensions and economic warfare. The mutual threats of retaliation between Russia and the EU over frozen assets, combined with Putin's critique of the international financial system, signal potential market instability and commodity price volatility. Continued conflicts in Ukraine, military deployments in the Caribbean, and maritime disputes in the South China Sea are heightening geopolitical risk, deterring investment, and disrupting trade. While China advances towards energy and tech self-reliance, this occurs amidst ongoing US sanctions and intensifying tech rivalry. Elevated defense spending by nations like Japan and persistent economic sanctions against Cuba further underscore a fragmented and uncertain global economic environment, where geopolitical events are direct determinants of market sentiment and economic performance.",

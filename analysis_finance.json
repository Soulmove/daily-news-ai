  "economy_summary": "Today's financial landscape was marked by a blend of domestic policy initiatives, significant international monetary policy discussions, and notable movements in tech and commodity markets. Domestically, China's National Development and Reform Commission reiterated its commitment to stimulating consumption through \"practical and innovative measures,\" aiming to curb \"involutionary\" competition and foster new growth. This sentiment was echoed by the Ministry of Finance's announcement to leverage government bond funds, including the issuance of ultra-long special treasury bonds, to stabilize investment and reverse its downward trend. These measures signal a proactive stance by Beijing to underpin economic growth, with Guangdong's AI core industry already reaching a significant 220 billion yuan scale, further demonstrating regional economic dynamism. Shenzhen also advanced green finance with its first green foreign debt pilot businesses. On the corporate front, major state-owned banks began distributing over 200 billion yuan in 2025 mid-term dividends, injecting liquidity and confidence into the market, while news of Vanke's three debt extension proposals being rejected by bondholders highlighted ongoing challenges in the real estate sector, despite a 5-working-day grace period. Internationally, the \"Super Central Bank Week\" saw Japan initiating rate hikes, marking a potential end to the easing cycle for many developed nations. This raises critical questions about the US Federal Reserve's path for next year, with speculation about the Fed potentially cutting rates \"alone.\" The ongoing race for the next Fed Chair intensified, with \"Cosmic Bank\" CEO's support for Kevin Warsh leading to a surge in his prediction market probability. Former President Trump also weighed in, stating his preference for Warsh or Glenn Hassett and asserting that the Fed Chair should consult him on interest rates, even suggesting a target of 1% or lower within a year. These comments inject a degree of political uncertainty into future monetary policy. Wall Street investment banks issued a cautionary outlook for 2026, warning that a market crash could trigger a US recession, reversing the usual cause-and-effect. US bank deposits also saw a slight contraction, falling from $18.528 trillion to $18.479 trillion in the prior week. Technology and commodity markets also saw significant action. OpenAI's GPT-5.2 reportedly received widespread negative reviews within 24 hours of its launch, indicating potential setbacks for the AI giant. In contrast, Yushu Robotics launched a humanoid robot App Store, aiming to create a smartphone-like ecosystem for complex robot actions, and Disney committed $1 billion to an OpenAI partnership, leveraging 200 IPs and Sora technology. Space exploration garnered attention with SpaceX's internal IPO pricing at $421 per share, valuing the company at $800 billion, while China's Zhuque-3 rocket experienced an abnormal combustion, failing its soft landing. In commodities, gold continued its rapid surge in 2025 as a safe haven, and platinum saw an impressive 80% price increase this year, being dubbed a \"gold alternative.\" The Moutai price also jumped by 150 yuan in the grey market following rumors of supply controls, indicating strong demand for luxury goods. However, broader US tech stocks experienced a downturn, with Broadcom shares plummeting over 11% following its earnings report, contributing to Nasdaq and S&P 500 falling over 1%. The general market sentiment appears mixed, with optimism around specific sectors like AI and green finance balanced by concerns over real estate stability, global monetary policy shifts, and potential market risks highlighted by investment banks. Funds appear to be flowing into strategic infrastructure, green initiatives, and specific growth industries like robotics and AI applications, while showing caution in broader equity markets especially after earnings reports.",
